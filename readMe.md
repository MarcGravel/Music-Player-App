### Why a music player?

Often when I am coding, I listen to background music. Youtube is full of ads that interupt the music,
while the music players on my computer are full of unorganized playlists and have too many features.

I wanted to create a simple "coding" playlist without having to scroll through the thousands of songs I have and 
re-organize everything. So Ill build my own simple music player to do exactly what I need it to do. Play music.
